Welcome, and I hope you're well.
This is my first time blogging seriously, and I hope to keep at it to keep myself accountable and give a glimpse into what I'm doing.
## Who am I?
My name is James Posse Hunt. I'm an Irishman from Tallaght, living in Aichi, Japan. I work at an eikaiwa called NOVA until next week, have a BSc in Computing with Software Development and I'm looking to get back into tech, so the blog is intended as a way to keep a record of my work. My plan is weekly updates each Sunday.

## The Plan
I plan to keep my eyes open while making demonstrable progress on dusting off skills I haven't used in a while. The first plan, to look into, is an AWS Certification, and I'll study for that along with studying Japanese. I plan to have that, and be at least JLPT N5, by the end of this year. The long term goal is to get up to at least N3 over the next couple years to be able to function well here.

I work for an eikaiwa called NOVA that was a good way to get me into Japan, but isn't much of a career. They offer relatively low pay with very high expectations (I've gotten moaned at for yawning in class) and it got to a point where I was so frustrated, I just couldn't do it anymore, so I handed in my months' notice which ends next week (my last working day is the 23rd of this month).

Stay tuned for updates, and thanks for reading!

# Portfolio Updates

This week, I made progress on the site, adding the resume page.

I also started working on the first app for my portfolio, which I call DD.

## DD
DD is a tool I started work on 3 years ago. I was starting to get into dungeons and dragons with my friends, and starting to run games in a class I taught at the time, STEAM Masters, after the children had finished their work. I, however, don't have dice.
My solution was to write a very simple program in Python using randint, and over time added Tkinter to give it a GUI.

This gives me output like this:

As well as this, it has half-baked character sheet functionality that I don't believe I ever published as it was clearly unfinished.

### So What's the Plan?

A complete overhaul, starting from scratch with a new UI built in DearPyGui (credit to Github user hoffstadt, repo found <a href="https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui">here</a>), a new file structure, character management, modularity and more features in mind.

I started the rebuild with the logic for dice rolling (the simple part) and will be working toward a first release soon - so stay tuned and once again thanks for reading!

<p>This week, I made progress on the site, adding the resume page.</p>

<p>I also started working on the first app for my portfolio, which I call DD.</p>

<h2 id="dd">DD</h2>
<p>DD is a tool I started work on 3 years ago. I was starting to get into dungeons and dragons with my friends, and starting to run games in a class I taught at the time, STEAM Masters, after the children had finished their work. I, however, don’t have dice.
My solution was to write a very simple program in Python using randint, and over time added Tkinter to give it a GUI.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/DDPic.png" alt="DD UI Screenshot" /></p>

<p>This gives me output like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/DDPic2.png" /></p>

<p>As well as this, it has half-baked character sheet functionality that I don’t believe I ever published as it was clearly unfinished.</p>

<h3 id="so-whats-the-plan">So What’s the Plan?</h3>

<p>A complete overhaul, starting from scratch with a new UI built in DearPyGui (credit to Github user hoffstadt, repo found <a href="https://github.com/hoffstadt/DearPyGui">here</a>), a new file structure, character management, modularity and more features in mind.</p>

<p>I started the rebuild with the logic for dice rolling (the simple part) and will be working toward a first release soon - so stay tuned and once again thanks for reading!</p>
